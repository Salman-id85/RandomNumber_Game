# Description
        To summarize a random number of lines of code in JavaScript, you would typically follow these steps:

1. **Read and Understand the Code**: Begin by carefully reading and understanding the purpose and functionality of each line of code.

2. **Identify Key Components**: Identify the key variables, functions, loops, conditionals, and any other important elements within the code.

3. **Condense the Code**: Summarize the code by focusing on its main objective or functionality. Remove any redundant or unnecessary parts while retaining the core logic.

4. **Use Comments**: Add comments to explain the summarized code. Comments should clarify the purpose of each section or line of code.

5. **Test the Summary**: Ensure that the summarized code still functions correctly by testing it in a controlled environment.

6. **Review and Refine**: Review the summarized code to ensure it accurately represents the original code while being concise and clear.

Remember, the goal of summarizing code is to provide a clear and concise overview of its functionality without losing its essence.
